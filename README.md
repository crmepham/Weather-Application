<h2>Introduction</h2>
This is a project I was required to do in the second year of my BSc Applied Computing degree. It is a weather application that displays weather information to users and includes an API for other developers to use the features included.
<h2>Functionality<h2>
<h3>Settings</h3>
1. Set your desired temperature (Celcius/Fahrenheit)<br>
2. Set your default location by providing the Postal/Zip code

<h3>Text search</h3>
Seach for a location using any or all of the search criteria available. If it finds the location it will provide the weather information for that location as well as center the map at this new location.

<h3>Map search</h3>
Scroll around the map and zoom in and out as necessary to find the location that you wish to know the current weather for. Then click the "Get weather" button. The application will present the weather for that location.

<h2>Technologies used</h2>
1. C#
2. WPF / XAML
3. Yahoo Weather API
4. Bing Map Control API

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
1. Re-design the text search to use only one single text field that can contain any and all search terms necessary.
2. Provide weather trend information: compare weather to last year etc. - implement using MySQL.
